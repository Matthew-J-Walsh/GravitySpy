[parameters]
; ---- wscan parameters.
; sampleFrequency: rate at which we resample the frame data. Keep in mind for an omega scan this effects the maximum frequency for which one can make their omega scan reach.
sampleFrequency = 4096
; blockTime: Before rescaling the omega scan to a given time duration this parameter effeect the duration of the TF map that omega original performs its tiling analysis on
blockTime = 64
; searchFrequencyRange: Range you would like omega to tile over. The relationship between the maximum allowable searchFrequencyRange and the sampling rate is as follows nyquistFrequency / (1 + qPrimeToQ / min(qs)) where nyquistFrequency = sampleFrequency/2
searchFrequencyRange = [10,1024]

; A FAR so to speak to determine whether the glitch is significant in terms of above the whitened noise for a given channel.
