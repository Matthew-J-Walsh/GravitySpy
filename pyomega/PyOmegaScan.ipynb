    "A huge thank you is owed to two people. First, Duncan Macleod for his work on GWpy which is utilized extensively throughout wscan.py. Please visit the [GWpy](https://gwpy.github.io/) site. Also, for his work on editing wscan.py and incoporating it into the larger GWpy framework. Second, Chris Pankow for his extensive use of iPython notebook from which I definitely copied some very well written and useful text."

    "in a loss in the measured signal-to-noise ratio. \n",

    "\n",
    "In other words, the dimensionless quality factor Q is essentially a measure of the signal's aspect ratio in\n",
    "the time-frequency plane and is roughly equal to the number of oscillations of the time-domain waveform over the duration of the burst.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
